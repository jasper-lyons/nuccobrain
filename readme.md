## How to setup this project

1. Install necessary dependencies with `npm install`
2. Compile code, watch for changes and start a dev server with `npm run dev`

If you want to build all project files and copy them to production server, use `npm run build` and copy contents of `/web` to the server.

Serverless function code gets built to the `/functions` folder insteadâ€”see below.

## Serverless functions

This project uses Netlify serverless cloud functions to proxy API requests to third party services like Eventbrite.

Doing it this way lets us:

* Keep API keys secret from the client
* Get around the browser same-origin policy
* Present smaller, simpler responses to the client

Function source code is in `/src/functions` and the built code is in `/functions`.

Unlike for the front-end code, the built function code _is_ checked into the repo and normal start/build commands don't affect it.

The functions can be rebuilt by running `netlify-lambda build src/functions`.
